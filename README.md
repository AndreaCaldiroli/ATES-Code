# EMDOT code

The EMDOT code has been created to perform hydrodynamical simulations of the atmospheric mass loss from irradiated exoplanets. THe code description can be found at << insert citation >>. In the following we describe the code organization and give a basi example of usage.

## Directories and files

The main directory of the code consists of the following elements:
* a `<src>` directory, where all the code modules are stored;
* the main code file `<Hydro_ioniz.f90>`;
* a bash script `<run_program.sh>` that takes care of the compilation and the execution of the code
