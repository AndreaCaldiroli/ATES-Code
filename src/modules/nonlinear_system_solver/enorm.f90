      !     **********
      
      !     function enorm
      
      !     given an n-vector x, this function calculates the
      !     euclidean norm of x.
      
      !     the euclidean norm is computed by accumulating the sum of
      !     squares in three different sums. the sums of squares for the
      !     small and large components are scaled so that no overflows
      !     occur. non-destructive underflows are permitted. underflows
      !     and overflows do not occur in the computation of the unscaled
      !     sum of squares for the intermediate components.
      !     the definitions of small, intermediate and large components
      !     depend on two constants, rdwarf and rgiant. the main
      !     restrictions on these constants are that rdwarf**2 not
      !     underflow and rgiant**2 not overflow. the constants
      !     given here are suitable for every known computer.
      
      !     the function statement is
      
      !       double precision function enorm(n,x)
      
      !     where
      
      !       n is a positive integer input variable.
      
      !       x is an input array of length n.
